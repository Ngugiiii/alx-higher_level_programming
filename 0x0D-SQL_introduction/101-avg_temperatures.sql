-- Select the city and calculate the average temperature for each city
SELECT city, AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp
FROM temperatures
-- Group the results by city to calculate the average for each city
GROUP BY city
-- Order the results by average temperature in descending order
ORDER BY avg_temp DESC;
You can copy and paste this query into your MySQL client to get the desired output. Just make sure you have a table named "temperatures" in the "hbtn_0c_0" database with columns "city" and "temperature".
